WHAT IS CRANIOSACRAL?
Craniosacral Therapy is a non-invasive, gentle yet effective hands-on treatment that can be profoundly beneficial to most people and most conditions - from minor aches and pains to persistent chronic health issues.
CST has a long history of development and has its roots in Osteopathy and in the life and work of acclaimed Osteopath Dr William G Sutherland.
<br>
CST enhances the body's own healing abilities. This process can influence the deeply held patterns of 'dis-ease' - physical, mental and emotional, that accumulate through life as a result of trauma, injury, stress and illness. All events in life are experienced by the body through a sensory network of nerves going to the brain - everything is recorded in the body's tissues and chemistry. The compensatory patterns of 'dis-ease' become held in the body and compromise the system, resulting in ill-health and dysfunction.

Through the gentle hands-on process of listening and observing the craniosacral system this therapy has the potential to transform these patterns of restriction and resistance in the body, releasing vitality and facilitating a return to health.

Two major centres of the nervous system lie in the cranial and sacral regions and the hands-on of CST encourages deep relaxation. This deep relaxation initiates the body's own healing and self-regulatory processes resulting in resourcing and restoring health.
