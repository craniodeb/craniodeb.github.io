      <p>All I do is <em>Hold you</em> Really your body does the rest. Trust me. WHAT HAPPENS IN A CST SESSION?
The practitioner will take your medical history and asses your current condition.
Thereafter you will lie fully-clothed, face up or on your side , on a treatment table.
Using a light touch the practictioner will 'listen' to asses the potency of your craniosacral system ( the membranes, fluids, tissues and skeletal bones that surround the brain and spinal cord). Sessions normally last an hour. <a href="http://www.cranial.org.za">Read more Craniosacral therapy...</a></p>
