      <h1>All about Craniosacral therapy!</h1>
      <p>All I do is <em>Hold you</em> <br>
            Really <br>
            your body does the rest. <br>
            WHAT HAPPENS IN A CST SESSION?<br>
The practitioner will take your medical history and asses your current condition.<br>
Thereafter you will lie fully-clothed, face up or on your side , on a treatment table.<br>
Using a light touch the practictioner will 'listen' to asses the potency of your craniosacral system ( the membranes, fluids, tissues and skeletal bones that surround the brain and spinal cord).<br>
            Sessions normally last an hour. <br>
            <br>PLEASE NOTE
The practitioner will not diagnose a condition nor prescribe a medication.
CST is not intended to replace medical care, but in many cases it may shift a persistent chronic condition.
It does not involve massage or manipulation.
